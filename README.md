# Ultimate White

_Visual Studio Code Color Theme_

Dark Mode users beware! This is not the color theme for you! This is the color that uses pure and perfect `#ffffff` white as background for everything. No dark activity bar in this theme - just white backgrounds everywhere, as it should be.

The `material-icon-theme` is recommended as icon theme.
